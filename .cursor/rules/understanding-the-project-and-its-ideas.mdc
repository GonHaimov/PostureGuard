Project: PostureGuard

Structure:
- backend/ → Node.js + Express + MongoDB. Currently supports register/login with MongoDB.
- frontend/ → React (Vite). Currently has Login and Register pages connected to backend.
- ml/ → Python + MediaPipe. Script collects CSV data for labels (correct, too_close, too_far, head_left, head_right, head_up, head_down). Currently hundreds of samples, target is thousands.

Future (high level):
- Calibration and user-specific baselines.
- Real-time monitoring UI.
- ML model training and integration.

Notes:
- Work will be done step by step, not all at once.
